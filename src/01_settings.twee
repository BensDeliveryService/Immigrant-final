  01_settings.twee — Story Settings & Initialization
===============================================================================

This file defines:
1. Global variables that the story needs to function (e.g. player name, 
   characters, flags).
2. Accessibility and UX toggles (high contrast, large text, etc.).
3. Other default values the game should start with.

The content lives inside a special passage:
- :: StoryInit → runs once at the very beginning of a new playthrough.
  Anything set here becomes available throughout the story.

Important for collaborators:
- Add new global state here if it should always exist when a new game starts.
- Use `$variables` (e.g. $playerName) for things that change during play.
- Do not put story text here — just setup values.
- If you add accessibility or gameplay options, initialize them here.
