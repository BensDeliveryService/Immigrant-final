<h3>Doubling Up - Shared Living</h3>

<div class="consequence-text">
<p>You've invited another family from the shelter to share the apartment with you. This brings the rent down to just $800 per month, which is much more manageable.</p>

<p>However, the situation is far from ideal. Your wife will be giving birth in the next few weeks and she's deeply concerned about privacy during this critical and intimate time. The apartment feels crowded, and there's constant worry about the other family's children making too much noise.</p>

<p>You've had to lie to your landlord about the arrangement. Every day brings the fear of being discovered - not just risking eviction and legal trouble with the landlord, but also the terrifying possibility of deportation if authorities get involved.</p>

<p>You live in constant vigilance, coordinating schedules to avoid being seen together, keeping voices low, and living in fear. The cultural values of honor and honesty you were raised with clash painfully with the necessity of this deception.</p>

<h3>Transportation Opportunity</h3>

<p>A few days into the doubled-up living arrangement, the other family brings up an idea over dinner.</p>

<p>"We've been thinking," the husband says. "Both our families need reliable transportation to get to better-paying jobs. Rideshares and buses are eating up our income. What if we pooled our money and bought a car together?"</p>

<p>He's found a reliable used car for $1,600. If you split it, you'd each pay $800, plus about $75 each for insurance and $50 for registration fees. Total: $925 for each family.</p>

<p>"We'd need to coordinate schedules," he continues. "Share the car for work, errands, everything. It won't always be convenient, but it would save us both money in the long run and open up job opportunities further from the bus routes."</p>

<p>You have $<<= $money>> in savings. The car-sharing would cost $925 upfront.</p>

<p>Worse, household responsibilities aren't shared evenly. Your wife's friend, focused entirely on helping with the baby, doesn't contribute to cleaning or cooking for everyone. The other family starts to feel like they're being taken advantage of.</p>

<p>After two weeks, the other family has had enough.</p>

<p>"We're leaving," they tell you. "We found another place. We can't live like this anymore."</p>

<<if $carOwnership === "shared">>

<p>But something unexpected happens.</p>

<p>The wife of the other family sees how hard you're struggling. She's been through this herself. One morning, she knocks on your door.</p>

<p>"I can help," she says. "I know what it's like. Let me take care of the baby for a few hours so you can rest."</p>

<p>From that point on, both families begin working together. They help with the baby. You help with their kids. Cooking becomes a shared effort. The apartment is still cramped, but it starts to feel less like a desperate arrangement and more like a community.</p>

<h3>Financial Arrangement</h3>

<p>You approach the other family with a proposal: you'll pay a larger share of the rent if the other wife can help your wife during her recovery. After some discussion, they agree. You'll now pay $550 per month instead of $400, while they pay $250.</p>

<p>At first, it seems like a good arrangement. The other wife knows what she's doing and helps with the baby, prepares meals, and checks on your wife throughout the day.</p>

<p>But problems quickly emerge.</p>

<p>The two wives have fundamentally different approaches to childcare. Your wife believes in letting the baby cry for short periods to develop independence. The other wife thinks babies should never be left to cry. When your wife tries to explain her approach, the other wife feels criticized.</p>

<p>Then there's the question of responsibility. The other wife agreed to help, but did that include doing all your wife's laundry? Cleaning your side of the apartment? Where does "helping with recovery" end and "being a servant" begin? These questions create tension.</p>

<p>Arguments start. At first they're quiet and tense. Then they become loud enough that both families can hear through the thin walls. The atmosphere in the apartment becomes toxic.</p>

<p>Your wife feels guilty and stressed. The other wife feels taken advantage of. Both families are miserable, and you're paying extra rent for the privilege of this conflict.</p>

<<if $carOwnership === "shared">>
    <p>The conflict escalates until it affects everything you share, including the car. After a particularly heated argument, the other family announces they want to end the car-sharing arrangement.</p>

    <p>"We can't do this anymore," they say. "We'll buy you out of your half when we have the money, but for now, we're taking the car. We need it more - we have more kids to transport."</p>

<p>With proper rest and care, your wife recovers faster than expected. By the third week, she's on her feet and feeling strong. The doctor clears her to return to light work.</p>

<p>"I want to help," she tells you. "You've been doing everything. Let me work while you take care of the baby. We'll take turns."</p>

<p>Together, you develop a system. She takes some of the jobs you would have turned down. You split childcare duties. The other family, seeing how well you've worked together, starts offering to watch the baby for an hour here and there so both of you can work at the same time.</p>
